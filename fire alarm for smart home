electric circuits project for engineering 
The safety of our homes is the saftey of our lives
The project portrays the critical importance of fire alarm systems and sensors in homes and other important buildings such as hospitals, schools, universities etc.
We want to demonstrate how it works and responds to flames occuring suddenly in dangerous situations on a small scale and we hope we send the message in the best way possible.
